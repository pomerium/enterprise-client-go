//worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
//copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
//publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
//Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
//
//3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
//this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
//worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
//(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

//where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
//by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
//Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
//with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
//institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
//cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
//or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
//or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
//granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
//as of the date such litigation is filed.
//
//4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
//Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
//modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
//meet the following conditions:
//
//(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
//Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
//
//(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
//stating that You changed the files; and
//
//(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
//that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
//attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
//excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
//the Derivative Works; and
//
//(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
//distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
//include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
//within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
//pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
//of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
//as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
//documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
//within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
//wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
//of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
//do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
//notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
//or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
//that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
//as modifying the License.
//
//You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
//may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
//for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
//for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
//reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
//the conditions stated in this License.
//
//5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
//any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
//by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
//this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
//Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
//the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
//with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
//
//6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
//names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
//except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
//origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
//
//7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
//agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
//Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
//WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
//implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
//of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
//PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
//appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
//risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
//
//8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
//whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
//unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
//negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
//liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
//incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
//result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
//Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
//work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
//other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
//has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
//
//9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
//the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
//and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
//or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
//License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
//on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
//of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
//defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
//incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
//of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
